Cat is animal
The cat is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to 
as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. The cat is either a house cat or a farm cat, 
which are pets, or a feral cat, which ranges freely and avoids human contact.
